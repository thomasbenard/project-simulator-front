# Project Simulator

A browser-based Monte Carlo simulation tool that estimates actual project duration based on probability distributions.

**Live demo:** https://thomasbenard.github.io/project-simulator-front/

## TODO

- [ ] Possibility to simulate links between tasks
- [x] Add task size variation
- [ ] Scale duration variance by task size (larger tasks have more uncertainty)
- [x] Add "number of programmers" parameter to parallelize tasks
